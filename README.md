👋 Hi, I’m Priti Thorve (@pritithorve)
👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development, with a focus on Java Spring Boot and Frontend technologies.
💼 I’m currently working as a Software Trainee Developer Intern at N-Intelligenz, where I’m gaining hands-on experience with Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
🌱 I’m enhancing my skills in backend development, improving frontend design, and deepening my knowledge of SQL.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on web development and backend system projects, especially those involving Spring Boot.
